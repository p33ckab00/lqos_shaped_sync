# MikroTik Setup Requirement


LQoSync is read-only against MikroTik. Before running live sync, create a dedicated RouterOS API group and user for LQoSync. This is an **Important Notice** / setup prerequisite for fresh installations.

Replace `<Strong Password>` and `<LibreQoS IP Address>` before pasting into MikroTik Terminal:

```rsc
/user group add name=API_READ policy="read,sensitive,api,!policy,!local,!telnet,!ssh,!ftp,!reboot,!write,!test,!winbox,!password,!web,!sniff,!romon"
/user add name="libreqosyncAPI" group=API_READ password="<Strong Password>" address="<LibreQoS IP Address>" disabled=no
```

Use the same credentials in `/opt/libreqos/src/config.json`:

```json
{
  "routers": [
    {
      "username": "libreqosyncAPI",
      "password": "<Strong Password>",
      "address": "<MikroTik IP>",
      "port": 8728
    }
  ]
}
```

This user can read the RouterOS API resources required by LQoSync while blocking write, reboot, policy, shell, web, Winbox, sniffing, and other unnecessary access. Limit the `address=` field to the LibreQoS/LQoSync server IP whenever possible.

> Note: Some RouterOS deployments may not need `sensitive` for the fields LQoSync reads. If your router still exposes the required PPPoE/profile/session fields with `read,api` only, you may remove `sensitive`; otherwise keep the policy above for maximum compatibility while still denying write/reboot/policy access.
